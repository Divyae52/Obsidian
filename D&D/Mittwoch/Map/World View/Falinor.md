Native home of Elves, Dwarves, Dragonborn, Gnomes and Halflings
The races mostly isolate themselves within their own kingdoms, but have a strained, but amicable relationship with everyone else in the continent.
The Marian Empire is currently expanding in the continent, and have started colonies (aka Human, Tiefling & Half-Orc populations are rising)
Other D&D races are rare here, but exist.

Surviving their surprise encounter with the giant crabs, the group decides to carve out any meat they can to add to their miniscule supplies. Assuming that it was now safe to do so, they make camp and rest for the evening. Braylon and Shriek, exhausted from the fight, rest for the majority of the night away from the group. The rest sit around the fire and share some of their life. 

Eventually - Henka, Spade and Jinx also sleep for the night; while Sir Lock Holmes and Windell rest without fully passing out, still not fully trusting their new environment. Zara, needing only a few hours of trance, decides to keep watch. In the middle of the night - Zara, Windell, Locklin and Jinx notice Henka suddenly get up and walk towards the ocean. They immediately realize the man is not awake, and Zara carefully redirects him back to camp. The three other witnesses decide to just watch this happen. No one tells Henka about his sleepwalking episode the following morning. 

The start of the next day is relatively calm. Using the map Braylon had in his possession, the group decided to continue following the coast south and go towards the small settlement of Jarvevaade. On the way there, they come across a shipwreck. Jinx, Locklin and Zara notice a few creatures walking around the wreck, most of them obviously not human. Jinx takes aim at one, and shoots it right on its shoulder.**

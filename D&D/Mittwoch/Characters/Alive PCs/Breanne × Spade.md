## Features

* Wild Magic Surge
	- Once per turn, the DM can have you roll a d20 immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect.
- Tides of Chaos
	- Once per long rest, you can gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Before you regain use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table after you cast a 1st level or higher spell. You then regain the use of this feature.
	- [ ] / Long Rest
- Font of Magic
	- You have 3 sorcery points that you regain when you finish a long rest. You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points as a bonus action.
	- Uses:
		- [ ] 
		- [ ] 
		- [ ] 
- Convert Sorcery Points
	* You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points as a bonus action.
- Metamagic
	- You gain the ability to twist spells to suit your needs.
	- Twinned Spell
		- You can spend sorcery points equal to a **spell's level** (1 for a cantrip) to target a second creature in range with the same spell, as long as the spell at the level it's being cast is incapable of targeting more than one creature.
	- Distant Spell
		- When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 ft. or greater, you can spend **1 sorcery point** to double the range of the spell (or make the range 30 ft. for a spell with a range of touch).
- Shapechanger
	- As an action, you can change your appearance and your voice. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your coloration, hair length, sex, height and weight. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You can’t duplicate the appearance of a creature you’ve never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have. Your clothing and equipment aren’t changed by this trait.

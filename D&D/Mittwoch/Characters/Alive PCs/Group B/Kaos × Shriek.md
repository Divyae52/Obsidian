## Features

* ***S*c*i*tz*o*phr*e*nic**
* Class Features
	* Sneak Attack
		* Once per turn, you can deal an extra 2d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack with a finesse or ranged weapon if you have advantage on the attack roll. You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 ft. of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.
	* Thieves' Cant
		* You have learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.
	* Cunning Action
		* You can take a bonus action on each of your turns to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.
	* Steady Aim
		* As a bonus action, you give yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this bonus action only if you haven’t moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.
	* Roguish Archetype:
		* Assassin
	* Assassinate
		* You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn in the combat yet, and any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.
* Species Features
	* Expert Duplication
		* When you copy writing or craftwork produced by yourself or someone else, you have advantage on any ability checks you make to produce an exact duplicate.
	* Kenku Recall
		* When you make an ability check using any skill in which you have proficiency, you can give yourself advantage on the check before rolling the d20. You can give yourself advantage in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
	* Mimicry
		* You can accurately mimic sounds you have heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds you make can tell they are imitations only with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check against a DC of 8+ your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.
### Feats
* Alert (From Criminal Background)
	* Initiative Swap
		* Immediately after you roll Initiative, you can swap your Initiative with the Initiative of one willing ally in the same combat. You can’t make this swap if you or the ally has the Incapacitated condition.

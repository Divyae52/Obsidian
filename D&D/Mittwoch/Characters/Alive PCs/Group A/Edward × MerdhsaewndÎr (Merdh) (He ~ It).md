## Features

* Fey Ancestry
	* You have advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](rules/conditions.md#charmed), and magic can't put you to sleep.
* Trance
	* Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

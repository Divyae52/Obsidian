## Features

* Elf
	* Darkvision
		* Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
	* Fey Ancestry
		* You have advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](rules/conditions.md#charmed), and magic can't put you to sleep.
	* Trance
		* Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
* Rogue
	* Sneak Attack
		* Once per turn, you can deal an extra `1d6` damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
		* You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't [incapacitated](rules/conditions.md#incapacitated), and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
	* Cunning Action
		* Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the [Dash](actions.md#Dash), [Disengage](actions.md#Disengage), or [Hide](actions.md#Hide) action.
	* Thief (Roguish Archetype)
		* Fast Hands
			* Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check, use your [thieves' tools](compendium/items/thieves-tools.md) to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the [Use an Object](actions.md#Use%20an%20Object) action.
		* Second-Story Work
			* When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.
			* In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.

### People are named in the following manner:
#### At birth,
they have 1 vowel in their (temporary) name, given by their parents, and no rare letters.
#### At 2-4 years old, 
they are taken to a church, where they are given a new name, with 1-3 vowels, and no rare letters. In addition, they are given a broad class.
#### At the start of puberty,
they go to a church of their broad class, and they are given a modified name, most likely with a W, however, strong persons may have an X, and weak persons may have no rare letters.
Through puberty (or even before), a person is to experiment with aspects of their class' subclasses. This is to prepare them for deciding on their class.
#### At the end of puberty,
they are one last time given a new name. This name represents their current power level. This name is never to be shared with any being, with the sole exception of (possibly) your spouse or your closest friend. It is your [[True Name]]. In addition, at this point in your life, until you reach level 3 at a minimum, you will be locked into a specific class. Based on what class and type you feel connected to most, you will also begin connecting with a [[Deities|deity]].
#### As you progress through your life, 
You will be found performing a ritual, most likely praying, with a deity often. At certain power points, your deity may provide you with a modified/new name, with more power. You do not have to inform anyone of this.

You’ve always heard of whispers of a mysterious island shrouded in mystery and danger; where the worst criminals and other rejects are exiled with no hope for return. It was the stuff of stories, a place where parents threatened their children they would go if they misbehaved; a place that is told around the campfire for a cheap fright. A place that was not supposed to be real.

And yet, here you are now; waking up aboard an unmanned ship as it docks on an island. You don’t remember how or when you boarded the ship, you don’t seem to even remember the past few days or weeks. Everyone else around you seems to be in the same situation, no answers on how you arrived or how to leave. As soon as everyone departs from the ship, you watch it sail out and sink as soon as it reaches the horizon. 

Welcome to the Isle of Mittwoch. Your new home.

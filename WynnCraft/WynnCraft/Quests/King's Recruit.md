#Tutorial #Level_1 #Quest #Ragni_Outskirts #Level_1-10

King's Recruit is the tutorial [[Quest]] for Wynncraft. It is a long level 1 quest that introduces players to the basic concepts of the game.

## Stage 1
» Awaken

An opening cutscene starts showing the area of the [[Ragni Outskirts]] right near the castle.

**Caravan Driver**: Agh!
**Tasim**: Hey, `playername`! You alright in there? Looks like we hit something.


## Stage 2
» Exit the caravan and talk to the Caravan Driver

**Caravan Driver**: Hm... I swear I hit this same darn boulder every time I make this trip. Sorry folks.
**Tasim**: Ah. Does this mean we have to walk all the way to Ragni from here?
**Caravan Driver**: Unfortunately so. Luckily, it's not that far from here. Just a straight path forward.
**Aledar**: Well, nothing to do but keep moving! Tasim, `playername`, I'll race you to the gate!

Aledar will then sprint to the gate.

**Tasim**: Wait, don't!
**Tasim**: ... He's already gone. We'll have to catch up to him. `playername`, lead the way.

## Stage 3
» Walk down the path towards the gate to the [[Wynn Province]]

**Tasim**: I don't suppose you know much about Wynn either, do you?
**Tasim**: Of course, the King of Ragni's been recruiting Fruma soldiers, but...
**Tasim**: That war of theirs must be getting pretty bad if they need this much support.
**Tasim**: Oh, there's Aledar! And the gate, by the looks of it.

**Aledar**: There you two are! You'll have to be faster than that if you want to stand a chance against the undead.
**Tasim**: Yes, yes, we'll be faster next time. So, is this the gate marking the border between Wynn and Fruma?
**Aledar**: It looks like it, yep! Are you two ready for the start of our new lives?
**Aledar**: `playername`, why don't you do the honors? Go ahead and open that gate.

`Playername` opens the gate.

## Stage 4
» Enter the Province of Wynn.

**Aledar**: Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go ahead and explore this province.

## Stage 5
» Continue through the Wynn Province to the castle

**Tasim**: So this is Wynn we've all been hearing about... It's beautiful.
**Aledar**: I guess the war hasn't made it this far. This is what we'll be fighting to protect.
**Soldier**: Hey, recruits! Come over here, I have something to tell you.

## Stage 6
» Talk to the Soldier.

**Tasim**: A soldier? What are you doing all the way out here?
**Soldier**: There's a bit of trouble up ahead. They sent me out here to intercept new recruits.
**Soldier**: If you want to survive out here, you're going to need this.
[+1 Oak Wood {weapon}] for each player
	[[Weapons/Level 1-10/Spears/Oak Wood Spear]]
**Soldier**: And for you two.
**Aledar**: Woah, awesome!
**Tasim**: Hopefully we won't have to use these just yet.
**Soldier**: Good luck out there, recruits! Just follow this path, and there will be a bridge up ahead.
## Stage 7
» Cross the bridge.

**Tasim**: Ah, this must be the bridge the soldier was talking about. But it certainly looks very...
**Aledar**: Well, let's not keep the King of Ragni waiting!

Aledar will run over the bridge as it collapses.

**Tasim**: No, wait!
**Tasim**: Aledar!

Aledar will pull himself back up.

**Aledar**: That sure was close!
**Tasim**: That's what I was trying to warn you about! Let's just get off this bridge before the rest of it collapses...
**Aledar**: Well, how are we meant to get to the other side of this ravine now? Ugh. Another thing gone wrong, just like-...
**Tasim**: ... Aledar? What's wrong?
**Aledar**: That's... weird. I was just thinking about something from before Wynn, but... it's gone. I can't remember.
**Tasim**: Hm. I can't remember anything from Fruma either... `playername`, how about you?
**Aledar**: Nothing. It can't be a coincidence we all lost our memories at the same time, right?
**Tasim**: No, but... We can worry about that later. For now, we need to find a way past this ravine. **Aledar**, `playername`, you should look for a way across. I'll keep looking here.
**Aledar**: Alright! Let's go, `playername`.

## Stage 8
» Search for another way across the ravine.

Turn to the left and a tree can be found. Use attack it. The fallen tree will bridge the chasm.

**Aledar**: Woah! That sure did the trick, `playername`. Good thinking!
**Aledar**: Hey, Tasim! Come over here, `playername` found a way over!

## Stage 9
» Continue onwards.

**Tasim**: Phew! We made it over safely this time at least.
**Aledar**: If we just continue forward, we should make it to Ragni in no time!
**Tasim**: Hmm? What's that guard doing here? We should probably talk to them if we want to pass through.

## Stage 10
» Talk to the Guard.

**Guard**: Halt, recruits!
**Tasim**: What? What's going on?
**Guard**: A group of corrupted have sieged this underpass. I can't let you enter without any armour.
Aledar: Then what do we do? We have to get to Ragni!
**Guard**: Do you see that cave over there? Caves such as those often contain useful loot that can help keep you alive.
**Guard**: If you enter the cave, you should be able to find some armour to protect you. After that return to me.
**Aledar**: What do you say `playername`? Let's go see what's in that cave.

## Stage 11
» Enter the cave and find some armour.

Go into the Grook's Nest Cave. Three [[Angry Grook]]s have to be killed in order to unlock the Tier 2 Loot Chest.

Open the blue and yellow rewards chest that spawns at the end of the cave once the loot chest has been opened. An Unidentified Helmet will be given.

**Aledar**: We should return to the guard to see if he'll let us through now!

## Stage 12
» Talk to the Guard at [-1298, 53, -1584].

**Guard**: So you found some armor, huh?
**Aledar**: Yes, a helmet! Will you let us pass now?
**Guard**: Hold on there, recruit. Before you can equip a piece of armor you first have to identify it.
**Tasim**: And how do we do that?
**Guard**: You can identify items at Item Identifiers. They exist in every city across the whole world, and we keep one here for convenience.
**Guard**: Identify your helmet at the Item Identifier and then return to me with it equipped. After you've done that I'll let you pass.
**Tasim**: Alright! Let's go, `playername`.

Go to the Item Identifier north of the Guard and right-click them. A menu will open up. Click the Unidentified Helmet and then click the check mark. The Unidentified Helmet is revealed to be a [[Tosach]]. Go back to the Guard and talk to him.

**Guard**: I see you have your helmet on. Fantastic, you may now pass. Let me open this door for you.
The Guard will then open the door.

**Guard**: Good luck in there recruits! Even with your armour it won't be so easy!

## Stage 13
» Enter the underpass at [-1288, 52, -1584].

After the underpass is entered, Aledar and Tasim will carry their weapons.
## Stage 14
» Continue through the underpass to [-1042, 67, -21517].

**Tasim**: Wow, that guard wasn't joking. This place is crawling with the corrupt.
**Aledar**: Well, we've got no choice but to make it through! Finally time for us to use these weapons we got. Let's go, `playername`.

Aledar and Tasim will fight the [[Undead Miner]]s in the tunnel alongside the player.

Once some buildings are reached, a cutscene will play showing a skeleton awakening. Two Undead Miners will flank it.

Aledar: `playername`, you take the skeleton in the front. We'll handle the two zombies in the back!
## Stage 15
» Defeat the Skeleton!

The [[Raised Sorcerer]] will fire a sequence of three homing projectiles as its main attack. Aledar and Tasim will fight the two [[Undead Miner]]s, which are just cutscene mobs.

**Aledar**: We did it!
**Tasim**: This path opened up, let's continue through the underpass.
## Stage 16
» Continue through the underpass.

**Lieutenant**: Over here! You're just what I needed!
## Stage 17
» Talk to the Lieutenant.

**Lieutenant**: Finally, some backup! Wait a second... you're straight from Fruma aren't you?

A large zombie will appear behind the Lieutenant.

**Lieutenant**: Oh well, this area should be clear by now. Ragni is just up ahead, after all.

The large zombie will run up to the Lieutenant.

**Tasim**: Lieutenant, watch out behind you!

The large zombie will grab the Lieutenant and knock the player, Aledar, and Tasim back. It will then start to run towards the player with the Lieutenant in its hand.

**Lieutenant**: Quick, you have to use an ability!

Unlock your first Ability by opening the Ability Tree int the Character Menu.
Spend an Ability Point on buying the ability to get it.

**Lieutenant**: Now cast your spell!

Cast your [First Spell] Spell!
The large zombie will flee as a result of that.

**Tasim**: Great job, `playername`!
**Aledar**: Wait, it's running away! We have to save the Lieutenant!
## Stage 18
» Chase the Goliath!

As the party runs down the cave, several walls of Corruption spikes will appear, as well as some groups of [[Undead Worker]]s, [[Undead Miner]]s. Aledar and Tasim will aid the player in combatting the mobs. At the end of the cave is the Corrupted Goliath.
## Stage 19
» Defeat the [[Corrupted Goliath]] and free the Lieutenant.

Once the Corrupted Goliath has been defeated, the Lieutenant will stand up, although visibly injured. The Corrupted Goliath will also drop an item on the ground.

**Lieutenant**: ... That was close. Thanks for the save, recruits!
**Lieutenant**: I think you three are going to make good soldiers - not many can handle themselves like you just did.
**Lieutenant**: It seems that beast dropped something, you should check it out before heading to Ragni.
## Stage 20
» Pick up the loot dropped by the Goliath.

**Tasim**: That item looks rare! Maybe there's an identifier around here.
**Aledar**: Onward to Ragni! We're almost there.
## Stage 21
» Enter the castle. A few [[Scarecrow]]s are seen (and can be attacked) on the way.

**Aledar**: We... we made it! We really made it! Sure was a close call at the end.
**Tasim**: ... Still think those corrupted don't stand a chance against you?
**Aledar**: Ha ha. Very funny. Ah, `playername`, there seems to be an identifier here for you to identify that rare helmet.
**Tasim**: And a blacksmith too, you can sell your old helmet there for some emeralds.
Identifying the helmet the Corrupted Goliath dropped will reveal it to be an Awesome Bandana. 

While the Tosach can be sold, it is not required to sell it to progress the quest.

**Tasim**: Here it is, the end of our journey.
**Aledar**: The end of one adventure, but the beginning of another! Let's go inside and talk to the King!

The King will be down the right hallway if you are facing the fireplace. As you approach him Aledar and Tasim will walk away.

**Ragni's King**: Ah, you must be the last recruit. Please come over here and speak to me.
## Stage 22
» Talk to Ragni's King.

As the player approaches the King of Ragni, Aledar and Tasim will finish talking to him and start to head out on their own adventures.

**Ragni's King**: Ah, you must be the last recruit. Please come over here and speak to me.

**Ragni's King**: Hello! Your friends just left. They told me quite the story about what happened to you `partymembers` on the way here.
**Ragni's King**: Welcome to the Wynn Province!
**Ragni's King**: This is the noble fort of Ragni, one of the oldest and most influential cities in the province!
**Ragni's King**: Your job as a soldier of Wynn is to stop the growth of the monsters that are ravaging the province.
**Ragni's King**: You might want to train a little more before hand, though. Many lives are lost everyday...
**Ragni's King**: ... Anyway, good luck! If you are lost, use map.wynncraft.com as it is very useful if you don't know where to go.
**Ragni's King**: Take this 1 [[Ragni Teleportation Scroll]] too! It will bring you back here if you use it.

The player may then leave the palace by following the hallway to their left.
## Epilogue
As the player exits the castle, they can speak to Tasim for more advice on what to do.

**Tasim**: ...oh, `playername`! Over here. Aledar's gone on ahead, but I figured I'd stay back and wait for you to be done.
**Tasim**: So! Wynn, huh? It's pretty exciting to finally be here. I'm going to head off in the direction of Detlas soon, but I wanted to tell you about something first.
**Tasim**: There's this handy item we were all given on our way here- the Content Book. It displays most things you can do in this world- quests, caves, and more.
**Tasim**: It also lets you track any content you want, which will create a beacon you can follow. Here, why don't you try it out? Use your content book, and click on the highlighted quest.

You will then be prompted to start [[Enzan's Brother]].

**Tasim**: Well, there you go! I'm going to head off to the end of the Emerald Trail, to the entrance of the Nivla Woods. You should meet me there once you've gotten a little stronger.

Tasim will then run away to the east gate of Ragni.
